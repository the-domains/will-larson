  Denise! at Indie Cage Match. June 5, 2016. We had a really good time. Here we
  are sitting around a candle at camp, telling eachother the worst thing thats
  ever happened to us. I've just explained that absorbed two twins in the womb,
  2 of them, and Jeff has told a story of leaving the gate open and letting 47
  Corgis escape, where they found a construction site and fell into a pool of
  wet cement. The cement dried with just their little noses sticking out.
